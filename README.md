Dude, seriously, I just finished watching Drop, and I have feelings. Like, I’m trying to process what I just saw. First off, how is it legal to create something this chaotic? 😂 It’s like, you dive in thinking it's gonna go one way and then BOOM, plot twist that nobody asked for. My brain is still trying to reboot. 

Anyway, adrift in their own mess, right? The characters? Wildly unpredictable, like my laundry days. Neither here nor there, but, man, entertaining. It’s like real people would never act like this, but hey, guess that’s why it’s a movie. Download the movie, they said. Nothing could’ve prepared me for it, though. 😅 You feel me?

> Okay, so there’s this one scene, and I’m like, just nodding along thinking it’s all chill and then wham! Either it’s genius or madness, can't decide! I mean, sometimes I'm just like, can't the characters just sit down and have a cup of coffee without making everything a big deal? And you see the art direction and wonder if they were going for “Let's make it aggressively weird but in a beautifully relatable way”? 😂

Oh! Totally forgot to tell you about this random guy who just kept popping in. Like, who are you? Why are you here? Do you have a backstory, or did you just wander into the wrong movie set? It feels like every scene he’s in is a whole new episode of chaos, LOL. Just watch the movie, and you’ll know exactly what I'm talking about. 

Unpredictable, quirky, sometimes just ridiculously over the top, but man, I couldn’t look away! And the way it keeps you guessing is kinda genius. Who comes up with this stuff?

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Console.WriteLine(What am I doing here?); }

Like, that’s Drop for you, in a nutshell. Tangled plotlines and all. Catch it when you can, seriously. Just don’t blame me if you end up questioning reality a little. 😜
